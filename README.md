# Yelp-Health-Scoring
**********  Download Yelp Dataset from https://www.yelp.com/dataset and place in dataset folder******

Then run following to output all files in "output" directory:
  sh runHealthSentiment.sh

There is an intermediary step, where the terminal pauses and you have to label the clusters from cluster.csv, see the sample_output example for an example formatting. 

For testing on full size dataset, change datapaths in shell script to the appropriate json files.

Feel free to use with citations, and enjoy!
